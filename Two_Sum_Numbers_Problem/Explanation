1. 
Given an array of integers, return the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. 
Return the array of elements in sorted order. 
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
If no numbers add up to specific target then return empty array. 

For Example:
Input: [1,5,-9,-4,8,-1], 7
Output: [-1,8]

Ans: 

Here we can use 3 approaches to solve this program. 1st is to use two for loops. 2nd to use dictionary to make more time efficient. 
and 3rd is sort the existed array then use two pointers, one at start and one at end. then move those pointers according adding respective elements. 

Lets have a look at the attached solution in python file.
